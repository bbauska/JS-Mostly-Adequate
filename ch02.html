<h1>Chapter 02: First Class Functions</h1>

<h2>A Quick Review</h2>
<p>When we say functions are "first class", we mean they are just like everyone else... 
so in other words a normal class. We can treat functions like any other data type and 
there is nothing particularly special about them - they may be stored in arrays, passed 
around as function parameters, assigned to variables, and what have you.</p>

<p>That is JavaScript 101, but worth mentioning since a quick code search on github will 
reveal the collective evasion, or perhaps widespread ignorance of this concept. Shall 
we go for a feigned example? We shall.</p>

```js
const hi = name =&gt; `Hi ${name}`;
const greeting = name =&gt; hi(name);
```

<p>Here, the function wrapper around `hi` in `greeting` is completely redundant. Why? 
Because functions are <i>callable</i> in JavaScript. When `hi` has the `()` at the end 
it will run and return a value. When it does not, it simply returns the function stored 
in the variable. Just to be sure, have a look yourself:</p>


```js
hi; // name => `Hi ${name}`
hi("jonas"); // "Hi jonas"
```

<p>Since `greeting` is merely in turn calling `hi` with the very same argument, we could 
simply write:</p>

```js
const greeting = hi;
greeting("times"); // "Hi times"
```

<p>In other words, `hi` is already a function that expects one argument, why place another 
function around it that simply calls `hi` with the same bloody argument? It doesn't make 
any damn sense. It's like donning your heaviest parka in the dead of July just to blast 
the air and demand an ice lolly.</p>

<p>It is obnoxiously verbose and, as it happens, bad practice to surround a function with 
another function merely to delay evaluation (we'll see why in a moment, but it has to do 
with maintenance).</p>

<p>A solid understanding of this is critical before moving on, so let's examine a few more 
fun examples excavated from the library of npm packages.</p>

```js
// ignorant
const getServerStuff = callback =&gt; ajaxCall(json =&gt; callback(json));

// enlightened
const getServerStuff = ajaxCall;
```

<p>The world is littered with ajax code exactly like this. Here is the reason both are 
equivalent:</p>

```js
// this line
ajaxCall(json =&gt; callback(json));

// is the same as this line
ajaxCall(callback);

// so refactor getServerStuff
const getServerStuff = callback => ajaxCall(callback);

// ...which is equivalent to this
const getServerStuff = ajaxCall; // &lt;-- look mum, no ()'s
```

<p>And that, folks, is how it is done. Once more so that we understand why I'm being so 
persistent.</p>

```js
const BlogController = {
  index(posts) { return Views.index(posts); },
  show(post) { return Views.show(post); },
  create(attrs) { return Db.create(attrs); },
  update(post, attrs) { return Db.update(post, attrs); },
  destroy(post) { return Db.destroy(post); },
};
```

<p>This ridiculous controller is 99% fluff. We could either rewrite it as:</p>

```js
const BlogController = {
  index: Views.index,
  show: Views.show,
  create: Db.create,
  update: Db.update,
  destroy: Db.destroy,
};
```

<p>... or scrap it altogether since it does nothing more than just bundle our Views and 
Db together.</p>

<h2>Why Favor First Class?</h2>

<p>Okay, let's get down to the reasons to favor first class functions. As we saw in the 
`getServerStuff` and `BlogController` examples, it's easy to add layers of indirection 
that provide no added value and only increase the amount of redundant code to maintain 
and search through.</p>

<p>In addition, if such a needlessly wrapped function must be changed, we must also need 
to change our wrapper function as well.</p>

```js
httpGet('/post/2', json => renderPost(json));
```

<p>If `httpGet` were to change to send a possible `err`, we would need to go back and 
change the "glue".</p>

```js
// go back to every httpGet call in the application and explicitly pass err along.
httpGet('/post/2', (json, err) =&gt; renderPost(json, err));
```

<p>Had we written it as a first class function, much less would need to change:</p>

```js
// renderPost is called from within httpGet with however many arguments it wants
httpGet('/post/2', renderPost);
```

<p>Besides the removal of unnecessary functions, we must name and reference arguments. 
Names are a bit of an issue, you see. We have potential misnomers - especially as the 
codebase ages and requirements change.</p>

<p>Having multiple names for the same concept is a common source of confusion in 
projects. There is also the issue of generic code. For instance, these two functions 
do exactly the same thing, but one feels infinitely more general and reusable:</p>

```js
// specific to our current blog
const validArticles = articles =&gt; 
  articles.filter(article =&gt; article !== null && article !== undefined),

// vastly more relevant for future projects
const compact = xs =&gt; xs.filter(x =&gt; x !== null && x !== undefined);
```

<p>By using specific naming, we've seemingly tied ourselves to specific data (in this 
case `articles`). This happens quite a bit and is a source of much reinvention.</p>

<p>I must mention that, just like with Object-Oriented code, you must be aware of `this` 
coming to bite you in the jugular. If an underlying function uses `this` and we call it 
first class, we are subject to this leaky abstraction's wrath.</p>

```js
const fs = require('fs');

// scary
fs.readFile('freaky_friday.txt', Db.save);

// less so
fs.readFile('freaky_friday.txt', Db.save.bind(Db));
```

<p>Having been bound to itself, the `Db` is free to access its prototypical garbage 
code. I avoid using `this` like a dirty nappy. There's really no need when writing 
functional code. However, when interfacing with other libraries, you might have to 
acquiesce to the mad world around us.</p>

<p>Some will argue that `this` is necessary for optimizing speed. If you are the micro-
optimization sort, please close this book. If you cannot get your money back, perhaps 
you can exchange it for something more fiddly.</p>

<p>And with that, we're ready to move on.</p>
